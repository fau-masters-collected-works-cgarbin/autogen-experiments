# AutoGen experiments

This project is a learning exercise on learning LLM agents using [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/).

## How to use this project

If you haven't done so yet, [prepare the environment](#preparing-the-environment). If you have already prepared the environment, activate it with `source venv/bin/activate`.

Each notebook is a self-contained experiment. You can run them in any order.

You may need to select a Python kernel the first time you open a notebook. Choose the kernel from the virtual environment you created.

## Preparing the environment

This is a one-time step. If you have already done this, just activate the virtual environment with `source venv/bin/activate`.

Run the following commands to create a virtual environment and install the required packages.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
